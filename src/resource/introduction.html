    <p>
    Modesto is still <b>under construction</b> and currently only able to
    </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Load and play MIDI files on /dev/midi (default) and /dev/ttyS0
      <li>Mute tracks
      <li>Add tracks
      <li>Edit some track parameters (name, program, channel)
      <li>Selecting input and output channels
      <li>Monitor a MIDI track
      <li>Record, store and play MIDI and Audio Tracks
      <li>MIDI isn't stored in MIDI files.
      <li>Audio is stored to and read from 44100Hz, 16 Bit, stero WAV
          Files
      <li>automatically increase channel when creating a new midi track
      <li>midi tracks for the same channel should share the program
    </ul>

    <p>
    Some known issues to be fixed next:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>muting an audio seems to stop the audio track
          (which seems a fine idea but when resuming we should jump
          to the correct position)
      <li>converting the audio input to mono is currently
          hard encoded and not an option
      <li>need to change the volume and pan of tracks
      <li>mmap needed when playing audio tracks?
      <li>monitor doesn't work on audio
      <li>optional simple echo effect on audio track
      <li>metronom
      <li>loops
      <li>graphical midi event editor
      <li>after loading a new midi track the track window on
          the left is accessing non existent models (trackname)
    </ul>
    
    <p>
    The next steps will be to:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Stop'n Resume playing a MIDI Track
      <li>Show the current time in the Transport Window
      <li>Configure IO Ports (Video, Audio, MIDI)
      <li>Load'n Store IO Port Configuration
      <li>...
      <li>Multiple Sequences
      <li>Arrange Sequences
      <li>Cut Sequences
      <li>...
      <li>Video
      <li>...
      <li>Images (ie. JPEG or TOADs vector graphics)
      <li>...
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Tips</h2>

    <h3>Audio</h3>
    
    <p>Modesto uses ALSA for audio input and output. It doesn't provide
    access to the mixer controlls but another program like 
    <code>alsamixer</code> can be used instead.<br>
    The space bar will toggle capturing (aka recording) and the 'M' key will
    toggle muting.</p>

    <p>With the following option, microphone input will not be send 
    directly to the soundcards output but is routed through Modesto:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Mic: Capture &amp; mute on
      <li>AD Input: Set mute to on
    </ul>
    <p>You may also want set "Mic Boost" to on (by disabling) mute.</p>
